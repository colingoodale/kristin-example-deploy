# kristin-example-deploy
This a sample deploy for my student Kristen. It covers the base deployment modules and script for a REACT app tethered to an internal Express.js server. This is not a professional production level build, but an educational production level build. Concurrently and if-env must be downloaded directly to the root folder for this app build to work proeprly on localhost.
